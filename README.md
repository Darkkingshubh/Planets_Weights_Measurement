Make sure you only need to type the number of planets you are on solarsystem.
Example :

Earth Weight - your actual weight like say 84 Kg

And type the number only from range 1 till 7. NOT 0, I do not include 0. THIS IS NOT BINARY !!!
1 for Mercury weight
2 for Venus Weight

4 for Jupiter Weight
5 for Saturn Weight
6 for Uranus Weight *giggle giggle, yes i am disgusted as well*
